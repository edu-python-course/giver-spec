Anonymous Giver Site
====================

The project is inspired by "Secret Santa" (aka "Secret Nicholas") Christmas
tradition, but it is not focusing on some specific celebrations or events.
The primary objective is to create a place on the internet where people can
gather together in groups and give anonymous gift one each other.

Key features
------------

.. rubric:: Wish lists

Any registered user can create and modify their own wish lists. The wish list
is generally private and is not available for any other users, unless they are
not assigned to be a gift-giver to a person.

.. rubric:: Many gift-giving campaigns

Users can join many gift-giving campaigns. There is no limit on groups number.

.. rubric:: Personal reminders

Users without (or with empty) wish lists will be prompted to place something
there. As well as dormant users will be prompted to join some gift-giving
campaign.

.. rubric:: Administration can't get in the way

Site admins perform wish lists moderation and gift-giving campaign support, and
cannot cancel, modify or remove users events.
